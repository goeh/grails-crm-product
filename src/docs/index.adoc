== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Product Management Plugin

This plugin provide storage and services for managing products in {gr8crm} applications. A product is an item that you
sell or have in your inventory. A product have properties like identification number, name, description and product group.
The following features are supported by the +crm-product+ plugin.

- Multiple prices, specified by price lists
- Staggered prices
- Product compositions (includes, replaces, equivalent, etc.)
- Attachments (images, brochures) if combined with the +crm-content+ plugin
- Reference to product suppliers if combined with the +crm-contact+ plugin

Note that this plugin does not contain any user interface components. This plugin contains domain classes and services only.
The plugin http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-product-ui/[crm-product-ui] provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface
for managing products and price lists. +crm-product-ui+ depends on +crm-product+ so you only need to include +crm-product-ui+
in your BuildConfig.groovy if you want end-user product management features.

|===

== CrmProductService

Like most other {gr8crm} plugins this plugin have a main service with methods for creating, searching and updating products.

=== Create a product group

+CrmProductGroup createProductGroup(Map params, boolean save = false)+

A product belongs to a product group. Product groups can be created with +createProductGroup()+.

=== Create a price list

+CrmPriceList createPriceList(Map params, boolean save = false)+

A product can have multiple prices. Each product price references a price list. A price list can be created with a call to +createPriceList()+.

=== Create a new product

+CrmProduct createProduct(Map params, boolean save = false)+

To create a product you call the createProduct method with a map of property values.

[source,groovy]
.CreateUsbCable.groovy
----
def hardware = crmProductService.createProductGroup(name: "Hardware", true)
def std = crmProductService.createPriceList(param: 'standard', name: 'Standard price list', true)
def product = crmProductService.createProduct(number: "USB18", name: "USB Cable 1.8 meter", group: hardware, true)
product.addToPrices(priceList: std, unit: 'pcs', outPrice: 6.99, vat: 0.20)
println "The price for $product is €${product.price} excl. VAT"
----

=== Search for products

As usual in {gr8crm} plugins the main service has a +list()+ method that performs a query.

TIP: The +list()+ method is +@Selectable+ which means you can use the +selection+ plugin to query for products.

+def list(Map query, Map params)+

To search for products you initialize the +query+ map with query values. With the +params+ map you can specify things like
sort order and pagination. The following query keys can be used in the +query+ map.

[options="header",cols="25,25,50"]
|===
| Key             | Description            | Type
| number          | Product number         | String (wildcard supported)
| name            | Product name           | String (wildcard supported)
| group           | Product group          | String (wildcard supported)
| supplier        | Name of supplier       | String (wildcard supported)
| suppliersNumber | Supplier's item number | String (wildcard supported)
| barcode         | Bar code               | String (wildcard supported)
| customsCode     | Customs code           | String (wildcard supported)
| weight          | Weight                 | Double
| price           | Product price          | Double
| enabled         | Enabled/disabled       | boolean
|===

The following example will find all enabled products in the *hardware* product group that has *usb* in the product name.
As you can see you can combine several query values when you search for domain instances.

[source,groovy]
.FindUsbProducts.groovy
----
def result = crmProductService.list([group: 'hardware', name: '*usb*', enabled: true], [:])
println "Found ${result.size()} USB products"
----

=== Product price

+Double getPrice(String productNumber, Integer amount = null, Object priceList = null, String unit = null)+

Because a product can have many prices depending on different price lists or how many items you want to buy,
retrieving the product price can be complicated. However there is a +price+ property on +CrmProduct+ that makes it easier.
The price property returns the first available price on the product instance. This works well if you only have one
price per product. If you have multiple prices per product you can use +CrmProduct#getPrice(...)+ with optional parameters
or use +CrmProductService#getPrice(...)+.

CrmProductService#getPrice() parameters

- *productNumber* Product number to get price for
- *amount* Amount to base price on
- *priceList* +CrmPriceList+ instance or CrmPriceList.param string
- *unit* unit to get price for

[source,groovy]
.TestProductPrices.groovy
----
def pc = crmProductService.createProductGroup(name: "PC", true)
def priceList = crmProductService.createPriceList(param: "b2b", name: "Small Businesses", true)
def p = crmProductService.createProduct(number: "dellxps15", name: "Dell XPS 15\"", group: pc)

p.addToPrices(priceList: priceList, unit: 'pcs', fromAmount: 1, inPrice: 0, outPrice: 1299.99, vat: 0.20)
p.addToPrices(priceList: priceList, unit: 'pcs', fromAmount: 10, inPrice: 0, outPrice: 1199.99, vat: 0.20)
p.addToPrices(priceList: priceList, unit: 'pcs', fromAmount: 100, inPrice: 0, outPrice: 999.99, vat: 0.20)

p.save(flush: true)

assert crmProductService.getPrice("dellxps15") == 1299.99
assert crmProductService.getPrice("dellxps15", 1) == 1299.99
assert crmProductService.getPrice("dellxps15", 5) == 1299.99
assert crmProductService.getPrice("dellxps15", 15) == 1199.99
assert crmProductService.getPrice("dellxps15", 50) == 1199.99
assert crmProductService.getPrice("dellxps15", 150) == 999.99
----

=== Delete a product

+String deleteProduct(CrmProduct crmProduct)+

A product can be deleted with a call to +deleteProduct+. If the operation succeeds the name of the deleted product will be returned.
Otherwise an exception will be thrown.

Before the product is deleted the +crmProduct.delete+ event will be sent and after the deletion +crmProduct.deleted+ will be sent.
